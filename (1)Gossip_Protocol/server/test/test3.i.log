Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Search your soul and re-awaken the undying light!

On that day, when the sky fell away
Our world came to an end
In our eyes did a fading sunrise in the dark
Glimmering shadows

Silence grows in the spaces between
Stretching out beyond time
Rising up as the chorus of souls finds a voice
Flickering through the void!

These little sparks cling onto life
Everyone caught in the struggle
And then the storms of change
They fan the flames scattering ashes to the wind!

Every soul contains a whisper of light
Gleaming faintly as it dwindles from sight
No escape, no greater fate to be made!
In the end the chains of time will not break

Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Search your soul and re-awaken the undying light!

As fate spins a thread without end
New life draws it's first breath
Blossoming in a soil reclaimed from the past
Where destiny holds fast!

Here where we stand hand clenched in hand
Everyone caught in the struggle
This is the day we finally find
A way stepping into our tomorrow!

Every soul contains a whisper of light
Growing louder as it calls to unite
From the distance sings a chorus of souls
Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals

Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Light will guide you on your way to the Ultimate Fight!

Every soul contains a whisper of light

Light will guide you on your way to the Ultimate Fight!
